# Demo Files For VE482 Lab6

Lab 6 is not an easy one and may consume much of your time. You haev to refer to many manual pages for the usage of some functions. To ease you work, I decide to provide you with some demo programs and will explain them during the lab.

## Basic Demo

Directory `dl_basic_demo` provides you with the usage of functions like `opendir`, `dlopen`, and `dlsym`.

Please go through the code before the lab session. When you start to do lab work, do refer to the manual page again so that you can have a more comprehensive understanding of them by
```shell
man opendir
man dlopen
man dlsym
```

## Advanced Demo

Directory `dl_advanced_demo` provides you with a simple plugin model. It contains the minimum functions needed for a plugin-based program to run. You should consider much more than it when doing lab work.
